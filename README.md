# DESCRIPTION

Chef's cookbook to change an IP address on a node server and set it to static
based on attributes defined in a JSON file. This has been tested and verified
working on Ubuntu 12.04, and Centos 7. On Ubuntu, this recipe will edit
`/etc/network/interfaces`, and `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<name>` on
Centos.

# REQUIREMENTS

## Platform:

The cookbook aims to be platform independent, but it's tested on Ubuntu 12.04, and CentOS 7.

# USAGE:

Add your cookbook to the chef server:

```shell
knife cookbook upload chef-ipaddress
```

You will need a data bag named "servers".
The following is a sample data bag item for Ubuntu:

```json
{
    "id": "server1",
    "interfaces": {
        "eth0": {
            "address": "192.168.1.2",
            "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
            "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
            "dns-nameservers": "192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2",
            "dns-search": "test-domain.com"
        },
        "eth1": {
            "address": "192.168.2.2",
            "netmask": "255.255.255.0"
        }
    }
}
```

For a CentOS server, you might want something like this:

```json
{
    "id": "server1",
    "interfaces": {
        "eth0": {
            "device": "eth0",
            "bootproto": "none",
            "onboot": "yes",
            "ipaddr": "192.168.1.2",
            "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
            "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
            "dns1": "192.168.1.1",
            "dns2": "192.168.1.3"
        },
        "eth1": {
            "device": "eth1",
            "bootproto": "none",
            "onboot": "yes",
            "ipaddr": "192.168.2.3",
            "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
            "gateway": "192.168.2.1",
            "dns1": "192.168.2.1",
            "dns2": "192.168.2.2"
        }
    }
}
```

Assume you have a file called `server1.json`. Use the knife command to add this
data bag to your chef server before you add this to the run list. The JSON file
name must match the name of the nodename in chef or this will not work. Or,
set the attribute `set_hostname` below when you add it to the run list.

```shell
knife data bag from file servers server1.json
```

## Notes

By default, the cookbook will _not_ restart the networking service.
If you want the cookbook to restart your network service,
set `default['chef_ipaddress']['restart_networking']` to `true`.

This recipe will not attempt to do any sort of error checking for you.
It will only copy what you have listed in your data bag to the relevant config files.

# ATTRIBUTES

`set_hostname` - this parameter only needs to be set if you are doing a bootstrap

`restart_networking` - (default false) controls whether or not networking will be restarted
